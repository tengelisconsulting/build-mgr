This coordinates a CI deployment for a webapp.

A response flow looks like this:
  - Receive request to build for a specific git rev
  - Validate request
  - Delegate to some kind of build runner to perform this build
  - If successful, extract the resulting assets to a served html directory
  - If unsuccessful, provide the build log as html in the served html directory

Running:
  Environment:
   - BUILD_CMD:         String that is passed to 'child_process.exec' as
                        command for build.
                        This command should take 1 argument, that being the
                        git revision to build for.
   - BUILD_MGR_PORT:    Port the build manager listens for work on
   - DEPLOY_CMD:        String that is passed to 'child_process.exec' as
                        command to deploy.
                        This command takes 1 argument, that being the target
                        git revision.

  Volumes:
  - /var/run/docker.sock:       mount the host docker socket here for
                                docker-in-docker
   - /app/build_dir:            workspace for build operations
   - /app/public:               directory intended to be publicly available
                                (ex. served by nginx)
