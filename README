This coordinates a CI deployment for a webapp.

A response flow looks like this:
  - Receive request to build for a specific git rev
  - Validate request
  - Delegate to some kind of build runner to perform this build
  - If successful, extract the resulting assets to a served html directory
  - If unsuccessful, provide the build log as html in the served html directory

Running:
  Environment:
   - BUILD_CMD:         string that is passed to 'execSync' as command
   - BUILD_CWD:         working directory for 'execSync' command
   - BUILD_MGR_PORT:    port the build manager listens for work on
