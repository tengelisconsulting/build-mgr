This coordinates a CI deployment for a webapp.

A response flow looks like this:
  - Receive request to build for a specific git rev
  - Validate request
  - Delegate to some kind of build runner to perform this build
  - If successful, extract the resulting assets to a served html directory
  - If unsuccessful, provide the build log as html in the served html directory
